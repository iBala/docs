# Working with Templates

Templates help you standardize your extraction process and save time when processing similar documents repeatedly.

## Creating Templates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Fields">
    Use the Schema Builder to define your extraction fields:
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```json Example Schema
    {
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "invoice_number",
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Invoice number usually found in top right"
        },
        {
          "name": "total_amount",
          "type": "number",
          "description": "Total amount including taxes"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Descriptions">
    For each field, provide:
    - Clear, specific field names
    - Detailed descriptions
    - Expected data types
  </Step>

    1. Click "Save as Template"
    2. Enter template name

  </Step>
</Steps>
